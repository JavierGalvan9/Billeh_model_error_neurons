# Modeling circuit mechanisms of opposing cortical responses to visual flow perturbations with the Billeh model
This repository allows the user to do the following:
1) Construct a version of the V1 column of the Allen Institute based on some parameters provided by the user.
2) Run the model on a stimulus selected by the user (here we use drifting gratings and full field flash), providing the V1 column with the instantaneous firing rates of the LGN units.
3) Analyze the particular behaviour of a neurons population regarding their response to the stimulus onset.
4) Generate the images used in "Modeling circuit mechanisms of opposing cortical responses to visual flow perturbations" by J. Galván Fraile, Franz Scherr, José J. Ramasco, Anton Arkhipov, Wolfgang Maass and Claudio R. Mirasso.
